Cold coffee is a creamy and popular cold beverage, that has mainly three ingredients â€“ instant coffee, milk, and sugar. Also called cold coffee shake or cold coffee milkshake, it is a perfect drink to sip on during hot days of summers.

The best part of this cafe-style cold coffee is the frothy layer on top, which makes it taste even more appealing. This recipe will give you the exact same coffee, that you might have enjoyed in different cafes or restaurants. You just need a few ingredients and it will get ready in under 5 minutes.
